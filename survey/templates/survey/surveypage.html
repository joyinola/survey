        <br>
        <p> You will now be asked to answer a few questions about the news that were found on the internet. The reliability of the news sources is uncertain. The sources will not b made visible to you 
        You will be asked to upvote or downvote some set of headlines.
        Please note that voting should be mutually exclussive, i.e., a participant can only vote on a single headline given two headlines. It's like a classic forced-choice task. So, for instance, if you originally upvote image 1 but then upvote on image 2, the upvote is removed from image 1. <strong>See the example on the next page.</strong></p>
